# Deep_learning_1
In this file I am building a deep learning model on the titanic data set. titanic data set is quite big data set but I have only considered 
numerical columns from the data (separate file for the numeric data is uploaded). This file is an example of classification model in which 
I have calculated the predicted probabilities of survival being True on the unseen data (pred_data from pred_data, uploaded separetely).

# important modules
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. Dense from keras.layers 
4. Sequential from keras.models  
5. to_categorical from keras.utils
